User can directly install the .zip files at their PC and then can directly run the already existing code. The pin have already been selected using CubeMX and the orignal code was generated using the Keil but can also be done in CubeMX IDE. Moreover, you can also run simulations on Proteus to see how the circuit and code is working. The RC Circuit at the end does require improvements but the PWM  is being generated smoothly at the output.
